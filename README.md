##Instructions I like

My **favorite** instructions that I like to use are ones with specific step by step precedures. Along with these procedures, pictures usually help with a visual undertsanding of how to do a task. Usually a visual aid is best when putting something together, and technical information is required. 

*Techincal information* for instructions include
 -short
 -to the point
 -give only information that is relevant to that specific step
